## :notebook:&nbsp; Overview

This is home to my mono repo for my Kubernetes cluster and home infrastructure. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository and makes the changes to my cluster based on the manifests in the [cluster](./cluster/) directory. [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/) encrypts the secrets so everything can be kept in a public repo as transparent as possible.

## :ninja:&nbsp; Updates

My personal GitHub app WYOA-bot runs a self-hosted instance of [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), every 2 hours, that handles the bulk of updating resources. For my personal dev projects, that I need/want deployed immediately, I use [Flux Image Update Automation](https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/image-update/)

## :computer:&nbsp; Infrastructure

Feel free to poke around in my [infrastructure](./infrastructure/) directory for ideas. This is still a WIP as I'm waiting for newer [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/) equipment to revamp my network. I plan on creating some Ansible playbooks for this soon. Most things deployed here are with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). Cloudflare is provisioned using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## :goat:&nbsp; Community

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [k8s@home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/) community.
This repo would not exist if it wasn't for the shared knowledge.
